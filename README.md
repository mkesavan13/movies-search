# Movie Search
This repository is created as part of homework for a ReactJS Mentoring session in my current organisation EPAM Systems

# Deployment
This project's `main` branch is hosted through Continuous Deployment using GitHub actions.

Therefore, whenever the project's main branch receives a merge or a commit, the code is automatically built and deployed to http://movies.krishnainfotron.com/

**P.S** - Will soon setup proper staging and production environments 

**NB!** - This app is purely created without using boilerplate npx create-react-app command
